# Workflow Guidelines
- The project involves:
  - Fetching raw data.
  - ETL processes between MongoDB and PostgreSQL.
  - Automating workflows with Prefect.
  - Integrating a vector store (e.g., Qdrant) for enhanced data querying.
  - Developing a `chat-ui` frontend using:
    - **Next.js** as the React framework.
    - **TypeScript** for type safety and maintainability.
    - **TailwindCSS** for styling.
    - Custom hooks and component-based architecture for modularity.
  - Connecting the `chat-ui` to the vector store to enable RAG-based querying through a user-friendly interface.
